This is a bot that serves silly quotes to Discord.

+ `main.py` the Discord bot
+ `.env` secret file you create with your Discord keys
+ `keep_alive.py` tool to run this bot from Repl.it
+ `mrwelch.txt` the main "things mr welch is not allowed to do" file
+ `shane.txt` some extra quotes from the Shane file

If you want to run this, you need to create a file named `.env` with your discord keys. *Do not check this file into version control.*
